# React Hooks

Types of React Hooks <br/>
    1. useState <br/>
    2. useEffect <br/>
    3. useReducer <br/>
    4. useCallBack <br/>
    5. useMemo <br/>

## useState 

    Declaring the state and modifying the state using useState() React Hook
    eg:
        let [count,setCount] = useState(0)
        above example, declares the state count and initialzing it to zero.
        Then using the setCount function, the state can be modified 
        Then the component can be rendered into App.js by
                      <StateHookDemo />

## useReducer 

    useReducer Hook is helpful if we need to update more than one state based on a actionType
    It has dispatcher and reduce function to modify the state based on the actionType been passed to the function

    Declaration:
            Import Reducer hook, and declare state(s) with dispatch and reducer function to handle multiple States as below
            const [state,dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {count: 0,showCounter:true})

            reducer function will take state and action as parameter
            const reducer = (state,action) => {
            It will set the state based on the action.type been passed 



##  useEffect

    useEffect React Hook is to do sideEffect and to fetch data, whenever state changes. It will get called whenever component mounted (initially), component got changed and component got released. Also, dependency can be added for which state, useEffect should be hooked.

        1. componentDidMount
        2. componentDidUpdate
        3. componentDidRelease
