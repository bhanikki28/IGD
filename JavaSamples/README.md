# Getting Started

### Imperative v Declarative Approach

	Code Sample to iterate through the list and adding filters;
	Filtering the list by Imperative approach ( declaring temp list to hold the filtered values )
    Filtering the list by Declarative Approach ( using Streams and filters )

## Functional Interface

    Using Functional Interface :
            Predicate  - Functional Interface to take one argument and do return boolen value
            Function   - FI to take one argument and return it
            Chaining of Functions - Chain Functions to do one or more operations , output of one is fed to another function ( PIPE )
                eg : apply(), andThen() and thenCompose()
